Most of the problem with susceptibility testing stems from turaround time and logistics. Our practive has about a 60 mile radius.  When I am on a farm where antimicrobials are recommended the client expects me to either administer an antimicrobial or give them directions on administering an antimicrobial.  If we start treatment before the results are back and the animal responds the client does not see any value in the testing. If we wait for results 2-4 days possibly as long as long as 5 and if  animals die or more animals are affected, the client is disappointed to say the least. Even when it is only 24 hours now we have to figure out how the client is going to get the recommended antimicrobial, do they pay another trip charge or try to take time off work to get to the clinic or come up after hours, if it is mailed or dropshipped another 1-3 days go by.
